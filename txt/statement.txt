Climate change is both caused by and impacting our power grid. On one front, the manner in which power is generated and distributed directly impacts our greenhouse gas emissions, lessening or worsening human-made climate change depending on the choices made. On the other side, extreme weather events and changing climate patterns present new challenges for keeping energy affordable, maintaining infrastructure, and preventing power outages.

What are microgrids, and where do they come in? Simply put, a microgrid is just a small power grid. It takes on all of the ordinary duties of a normal power grid (first and foremost, delivering power to homes and buildings) on a more local scale, ranging from a few homes to an entire town or city. 'Electrical islands' (microgrids not connected to a larger grid) have already been a vital tool in quickly and effectively bringing power to rural communities in developing nations for the first time, while on-network microgrids get many benefits of both small grids and large ones. These benefits make microgrids a clearly beneficial technological solution to many of today's electricity and climate problems.

Overall, microgrids improve resilience, increase responsiveness to local needs, and enable a faster and smoother transition to renewable energy. However, these grids are complex undertakings, facing initial regulatory and cost burdens and losing some economic and management benefits available to larger grids, in the same way that all small businesses encounter challenges while competing with large chains. Additionally, no one solution can solve every issue in the realms of climate change and power generation and distribution; energy efficiency, renewable power generation, and infrastructure upgrades are all necessary to maximize the benefits of microgrids.
