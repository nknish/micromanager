# micromanager

a text-based game where you manage a microgrid!

## description

- in this game, you'll navigate the excitement, challenges, and conundrums of managing a small-town microgrid
- you'll learn all about how microgrids work (with their many benefits and drawbacks) and weigh decisions that face real policymakers and public servants who deliver power to the public
- plus, you'll have help from a lovely assistant (probably) named bub

## installation

### dependencies

- you've gotta have [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) installed on your computer

### instructions

1. clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/nknish/micromanager/`
2. make your way over to the proper directory with `cd micromanager/bin`
3. finally, start the game with `java Micromanager`

## tech stack

- it's all java (because object-oriented programming is cool!)
- the story is stored in a bunch of json files to keep it nice and flexible
