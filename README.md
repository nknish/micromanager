# micromanager

**a text-based game where you manage a microgrid!**

a simple download will (hopefully) be coming soon! in the meantime, if you'd like to run micromanager on your own computer, you may be able to do so by following these steps:

_(note: you must have [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) installed on your computer)_

1. clone the repo (if you don't know what this means, scroll up, click the green `code` button, then click `download zip`. from there, open your `downloads` folder and double-click on the `.zip` file.
2. open your computer's command line or terminal, and set it to full screen.
3. copy and paste the following script into your command line/terminal:
   1. for `mac` users:
   ```
   cd downloads/micromanager-main/bin; java Micromanager
   ```
   2. for `windows` users:
   ```
   cd downloads\micromanager-main\bin && java Micromanager
   ```

...press enter, and that should be it!
